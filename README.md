# Grimora Mod

- A giant Mod made by Kopie, Arackulele, xXxStoner420BongMasterxXx that builds upon the finale with Grimora's
  chessboard.

- **IMPORTANT**: **ENABLE ENERGY DRONE IN API CONFIG IN ORDER FOR IT TO SHOW UP**
- **BEWARE**: THIS WILL UNLOCK CERTAIN STORY EVENTS IN ORDER FOR THE MOD TO WORK, WHICH ALSO MEANS UNLOCKING CERTAIN
  ACHIEVEMENTS!
- In the event you are starting from a brand new save, this mod will unlock all learned abilities, mechanics, and cards
  and some Story Events like the first tutorial battle, Bones, and a few others in order for this mod to work.
- If you are not starting from a new save, this mod will check for certain story events and determine if it needs to unlock those.
- I suggest restarting your game at least once if you haven't actually gotten to the finale.
- The most important, !!!THIS IS A BETA AND IS NOT BUG FREE!!!

- This mod is not tested with KC mod and we cannot guarantee it will work on that version of the game
