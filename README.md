# Grimora Mod

- A giant Mod made by Kopie, Arackulele, xXxStoner420BongMasterxXx that builds upon the finale with Grimora's chessboard.

- **IMPORTANT**: Disable energy drone (but not energy refresh) in the API config!!!
- **BEWARE**: THIS WILL UNLOCK CERTAIN STORY EVENTS IN ORDER FOR THE MOD TO WORK, WHICH ALSO MEANS UNLOCKING CERTAIN ACHIEVEMENTS!
- In the event you are starting from a brand new save, this mod will unlock all learned abilities, mechanics, and cards and some Story Events like the first tutorial battle in order for this mod to work.
- If you are not starting from a new save, this mod will check for certain story events and determine if it needs to unlock those.
- I suggest restarting your game at least once if you haven't actually gotten to the finale.
- The most important : THIS IS A BETA AND IS NOT BUG FREE!!!

- This mod is not tested with KC mod and we cannot guarantee it will work on that version of the game


## Special thanks to :

- LavaErrorDoggo for making a lot of the Artwork

- YisusWhy for the epic Bone Lord Artwork

## Known Issues:

### Grimora's dialogue is unfinished and still the one from the finale and part 1 dialogue in some cases

- This is a temporary problem and will be fixed soon.

### Energy Cards dont work

- Try enabling energy refresh in API config, that option may be unstable with this mod but should fix the issue until we implement a more proper solution.

### Black Square Sigils

- Install [SigilArtPatch](https://inscryption.thunderstore.io/package/MADH95Mods/SigilArtPatch/)

## Update Notes:

- Balance overhaul

- Fixed Blueprints

- Added 30 more Blueprints
